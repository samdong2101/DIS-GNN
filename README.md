# Getting DIS-GNN

## 1. Create Conda Environment
- While not mandatory, we recommend creating a clean conda environment before installing DIS-GNN to avoid potential package conflicts. You can create and activate a conda environment with the following commands:
- ```conda create -n deep_gasp python=3.12```
### Activate the environment
- ```conda activate deep_gasp```

## 2. Install required packages
- ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## 3. Install from source
- ```git clone https://github.com/samdong2101/DIS-GNN.git```
